## epoll

try to use epoll system in Rust

I wrote this scripts on OSX architechture

and added rustup toolchain for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.

However, an error occured when I built this code,

I think this may work well, but am not sure whether it works precisely.

(Update 2018/09/01)

This script works well on fedora 28 architecture.
